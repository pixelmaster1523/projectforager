This project is, in simple terms, a better information gathering tool than any human. 
The idea of the project is to go through every single website on google, filter the information (blocking most explicit information), filters the data collected,
sorts the information into individual categories and subjects (on a seperate computer), averages the information in that specific subject to make the most accurate answer.

This will be able to be accessed through a seperate smartphone or the built in console to find what you are looking for with exact precision and accuraccy to real life.

WARNING
If this does work, none of the information surrounding anything sorted will be shared. It is the most raw information anyone could find and quite possibly be quite graphic depending on the subject. 

All this project really is, is a few friends and I messing around with around 4 machine learning bots to gather as much information and store it safely. 

If you are going to try this, be prepared with a LOT of storage, a seperate computer and a lot of time.
